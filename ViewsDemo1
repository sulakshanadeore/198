--Views
--- its a database object like a table
----virtual tables
---- they donot hold data 
---- they fetch data from the underlying table/tables(base table/tables)
---2 types of views
 --a) Simple Views/Updateable Views
     ---- donot have groupby, join,subquery in its definition
		----only a select query while defining a view is a simple view
 --b) complex Views/Non Updateable Views
 ---- have groupby, join,subquery,etc in its definition
 ------------------------------------------------------------

 create view v1
 as  
 select * from Students


 select * from v1

 create view v2
 (studno,studentname,studentcity,studstate,studcountry,studDept)
 as
 select * from students

 select * from v2
 ----Abvoe is a simple view--
 ---Advantages of view
 ---1) Encapsulation--- u donot know the column names in the table via the 
 --view. they(column names) can be changed.
 --- 2)If its a simple view, u can do all operations on(via) the view
 ---that u do on a table
 insert into v2 values('Jay','Jamshedpur','UP','India',10)
 update v2
  set studentcity='Hyd',
   studstate='AP'
    where studentcity='Pimpri'

-----3)U achieve security over your database table, as the table name is known to the view
---and not to the user of view.
----4) U can select all/some columns of the table while defining the view

as 
select rollno,sname from Students
